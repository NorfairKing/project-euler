\subsection{Problem 6: Sum square difference}
\begin{problem}
    The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
    \[ 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385 \]

    The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
    \[ (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025 \]

    Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is $3025 - 385 = 2640$.

    Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
\end{problem}

\subsubsection{A Naive solution}
Let $p$ be $100$.

The naive solution is of course to just calculate both the sum of squares and the square of the sum.

This is an $O(p)$ solution and it's fast enough to reach a solution in under one minute.

\subsubsection{A better solution}
There is, of course, a better solution.
The question even alludes to it.

The sum of natural numbers up to $p$ can be obtained in constant time: \needed
\[ \sum_{i}i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \]

The sum of the first $p$ natural squares can be obtained in constant time as well: \why
\[ \sum_{i}i^{2} = \frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6} \]

This means that the solution can be computed in constant time.
