\subsection{Problem 5: Smallest multiple}
\begin{problem}
    2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
    What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?
\end{problem}

\subsubsection{A Naive solution}
Let $p$ be $20$.

A naive solution would be to start from $1$ and check every number for divisibility by every number up to $p$.

    \caption{A naive solution}

Even with $p=20$, this runs in under one minute.
This solution runs in $O(pN)$ where $N$ is the result.

\subsubsection{A better solution}
If we can find out what the prime factors are of $p$ then we can construct $p$ by multiplying them all together.
Let's start from $p!$.
We know that $p!$ is divisible by every number up to and including $p$.
There are factors that can be left out though.
Take $p=4$ for example. $4! = 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 = 24$ and $24$ is divisible by $2$, $3$ and $4$ but $12$ is also divisible by $2$, $3$ and $4$.
The reason is that is the case is that the prime decomposition $2^{2}$ of $4$ contains one of the factors: $2$.
All we need to do to construct the solution is find all prime \textbf{unique} multiplicities of all prime factors of the numbers up to $p$.
In the example, the prime $2$ has multiplicity $1$ in de prime decomposition of $2$ and multiplicity $2$ in the prime decomposition of $4$ so the solution for $p=4$ will have $2^{2}$ in its prime decomposition.

First we precompute the primes up to and including $p$.
\lstinputlisting[language=c, firstline=17, lastline=22]{\sol{005}{c}/solution.c}
Then we aggregate all the multiplicities of the prime decompositions of the numbers up to and including $p$.
\lstinputlisting[language=c, firstline=24, lastline=35]{\sol{005}{c}/solution.c}
Lastly we multiply all the prime factors together with their respective multiplicity.
\lstinputlisting[language=c, firstline=37, lastline=51]{\sol{005}{c}/solution.c}
Calculating all the primes untill $p+1$ takes $O(p\sqrt{p})$ time.
Calculating all mutiplicites takes $O(p\sqrt{p})$ time again.
Multiplying all the prime factors together takes time proportional to the amount of prime factors of the result.
This is less than $O(p\sqrt{p})$ \why so this solution runs in $O(p\sqrt{p})$.
